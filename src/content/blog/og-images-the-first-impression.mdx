Have you ever shared a link to your project and noticed how… _meh_ 😒 it looks?

No preview. No image. Just a plain URL with some sad gray text.

That’s what happens when you skip **Open Graph (OG) images** and **Twitter images**. These are one of the most overlooked yet powerful aspects of web development and personal branding.

In this post, I’ll walk you through:

- ✅ Why OG images matter
- ⚙️ How to set them up correctly
- 🐞 Common mistakes and how to fix them

---

## What are OG images?

**OG (Open Graph) images** are used by platforms like **Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, and Facebook** to generate rich link previews when someone shares your site.

They make your link:

- ✅ Clickable
- ✅ Recognizable
- ✅ Professional

Think of them as the **hero section** of your link preview.

Here’s how it looks in practice:
![The difference: With and without OG images](../../assets/articles/with-and-without-og-images.avif)

- ❌ _No OG image_ → Bland, boring link preview
- ✅ _With OG image_ → Branded, eye-catching, and clickable

---

## Why they matter

### First impressions count

People make click decisions in seconds. OG images can tip that decision in your favor.

### Free marketing

A good preview stands out—especially on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn where every pixel competes for attention.

### Brand recognition

Consistent visuals like your logo, colors, and tagline across previews reinforce your identity and professionalism.

## How to add OG images in Next.js (App Router)

If you're using **Next.js**, you’ve got two options:

### **Option 1: Static images** (simple & fast)

- Place `opengraph-image.jpg` and/or `twitter-image.jpg` inside your `app/` directory or route segment.
  ![Example OG image placement](../../assets/articles/og-image-placement.avif)
  Next.js will automatically use these images for OG and Twitter previews.
- Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`.
- If `twitter-image` is missing, It will fall back to `opengraph-image`.

---

### **Option 2: Dynamic images with `next/og`**

Use the built-in [`ImageResponse`](<https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata%23generating-og-images-dynamically%5D(https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata%23generating-og-images-dynamically)>) API from `next/og`.

**Example:**
`app/about/opengraph-image.tsx`

```ts
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { join } from 'node:path'

// Image metadata
export const alt = 'About Acme'
export const size = {
  width: 1200,
  height: 630,
}

export const contentType = 'image/png'

// Image generation
export default async function Image() {
  // Font loading, process.cwd() is Next.js project directory
  const interSemiBold = await readFile(
    join(process.cwd(), 'assets/Inter-SemiBold.ttf')
  )

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      // ImageResponse JSX element
      <div
        style={{
          fontSize: 128,
          background: 'white',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
        }}
      >
        About Acme
      </div>
    ),
    // ImageResponse options
    {
      // For convenience, we can re-use the exported opengraph-image
      // size config to also set the ImageResponse's width and height.
      ...size,
      fonts: [
        {
          name: 'Inter',
          data: interSemiBold,
          style: 'normal',
          weight: 400,
        },
      ],
    }
  )
}
```

## Recommended image sizes

- **Open Graph:** `1200 × 630 px`
- **Twitter Card:** `1200 × 630 px` (uses `summary_large_image`)

> 👉 Stick to a `1.91:1` aspect ratio to avoid cropping.

## Common bugs (and how to fix them)

**1. Image not showing on Twitter?**  
Use [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator).

**2. Image not showing on LinkedIn?**  
Use [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/).

**3. Wrong or outdated image?**  
Clear the cache using the above tools and verify your image URLs and metadata.

**4. Next.js app not detecting the image?**

- Files must be named `opengraph-image.jpg` / `twitter-image.jpg`.
- Make sure it’s in the correct route folder or root `app/` directory.

## Bonus tips for better OG images

- Include **project name**, **logo**, and a **short tagline**.
- Use **high contrast** and **readable fonts**.
- Keep images **under 5MB**.
- **Tools for manual design:**
  [og.new](https://og.new) | [Photopea](https://photopea.com) | [Canva](https://canva.com) | [Figma](https://figma.com)
- **Tools for dynamic generation:**
  `next/og` | [`vercel/og`](<https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation%5D(https://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation)>) | [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori)

## Final thoughts

You spend hours building a great product so don’t let it fall flat when it’s shared.

**OG images take 5 to 10 minutes to set up** and can drastically improve how your project shows up across the web.

So the next time you launch something, ask yourself:

> **How will this look when someone shares it?**

Because in a world of short attention spans, your link preview _is_ your first impression.
