After building my portfolio site, I realized something was missing ~ the feel.

You know that buttery smooth scrolling effect modern websites have? The kind that makes the site feel premium and effortless to use? I wanted that.

That’s when I stumbled upon **Lenis**

## What is Lenis?

According to the official docs:

> Lenis is a lightweight, robust, and performant smooth scroll library. Built by [@darkroom.engineering](https://github.com/darkroomengineering), it’s simple to integrate, optimized for modern browsers, and perfect for creating smooth scrolling experiences ~ from parallax effects to WebGL scroll syncing.

It supports:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- React
- Vue
- Framer

But in this article, we’ll focus on **Next.js (v16).**

## Using Lenis in a Next.js 16 App

> 💡 Tip: Even though Lenis is lightweight, always test on a new branch before pushing to production.

### Install Lenis

Using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install lenis
# or
yarn add lenis
# or
pnpm add lenis
```

## Add `<ReactLenis>` to your layout

Head over to your `layout.tsx` (root layout or a custom layout component — recommended).

Import `ReactLenis` component from `lenis/react`:

```tsx
import { ReactLenis } from "lenis/react";
```

Call `ReactLenis` before the components:

```tsx
return (
  <>
    <ReactLenis root />
    {/* content */}
  </>
);
```

For example:

```tsx
import { ReactLenis } from "lenis/react";
import { Header } from "@/components/header";
import { Footer } from "@/components/footer";

export default function Layout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <>
      <ReactLenis root />
      <Header />
      {children}
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

That’s it. You now have buttery smooth scrolling in your Next.js app 🧈

## Customizing the Scroll Behavior

You can fine-tune how Lenis behaves by passing options to the `<ReactLenis>` component:

```tsx
<ReactLenis root options={{ smoothWheel: true, lerp: 0.1 }} />
```

Here’s what some options mean:

- `smoothWheel`: enables smooth wheel scrolling
- `lerp`: controls scroll interpolation (lower = smoother but slower)

👉 [Check all available options here](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis?tab=readme-ov-file#settings)

## Bonus: Integrating with Animation Libraries

If you’re using `GSAP` or `Framer Motion`, Lenis can sync scroll positions for advanced effects like parallax or scroll-triggered animations.

This article keeps things simple, but you can explore [Lenis integrations here](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis?tab=readme-ov-file#packages).

## Conclusion

Adding **Lenis** to your Next.js app is quick, minimal, and visibly improves UX, all without sacrificing performance.

Try it out in your project and see the difference for yourself.
