When we think of HTML id attributes, we usually associate them with styling or selecting elements in JavaScript.

But here's a surprising behavior most developers either don’t know — or forgot:

> Adding an id to an HTML element can automatically create a global JavaScript variable.

Yes, really.

## 💡 The hidden behavior

Take this HTML code:

```html
<p id="preamble"></p>
```

In JavaScript, you can actually access it like this:

```js
preamble.textContent = "Hello, world!";
```

It just works. No `getElementById()`. No `querySelector()`.

Why?

Because the browser attaches elements with ids to the global window object — so window.preamble points directly to the DOM node.

## ⚠️ But don’t rely on it

According to MDN Web Docs:

> “Relying on this behavior is dangerous and discouraged.”

Here’s why:

- Future browser APIs might introduce global variables with the same name.
- It can conflict with your own global variables.
- It’s not reliable in strict mode ('use strict';) or modern JavaScript frameworks.

In short:

- ✅ Cool browser quirk
- ❌ Bad practice for production code

Use this instead:

```js
document.getElementById("preamble");
```

## 🧠 Final thoughts

HTML has all sorts of hidden behaviors that even experienced devs overlook. This is one of those small but fascinating quirks that show how deeply intertwined HTML and JavaScript can be.

Until next time

Peace, nerds! ✌️
