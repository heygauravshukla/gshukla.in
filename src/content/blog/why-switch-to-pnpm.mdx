As a frontend developer juggling multiple side projects, I was tired of slow installs and bloated `node_modules` folders. That’s when I stumbled upon **PNPM**, and it completely changed my workflow.

In this article, I’ll break down what PNPM is, why it’s better than npm, and how it can speed up your dev process while saving disk space.

---

### What is PNPM?

PNPM stands for **Performant NPM**. It’s a fast, disk-efficient alternative to npm and yarn. The best part? It’s a **drop-in replacement** — you can use the same commands like:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

It’s open-source and used in production by companies like **Vercel**, **Vue**, **Astro**, and many others.

### Why I switched — The key benefits

#### 🚀 1. Fast installs

PNPM is **up to 2x faster** than npm. How? It doesn’t re-download packages you’ve already installed. It just links them from a global cache — blazing fast.

#### 💾 2. Disk space efficient

When you install a package for the first time, PNPM stores it in a **content-addressable storage** on your disk. Next time (or in another project), it hard-links that package instead of downloading it again. No duplication = massive disk savings.

> One dev replied to my tweet: _"I’ll use PNPM just for the hard links!"_ — and honestly, that’s reason enough.

#### 🔒 3. Strict dependency isolation

PNPM creates a **non-flat `node_modules`** structure. This means packages can only access dependencies they explicitly declare — reducing bugs from undeclared or hoisted packages.

#### 🧱 4. Built-in monorepo support

PNPM supports **workspaces** out of the box. Whether you’re building a monorepo with multiple packages or just a monolith, PNPM handles dependency management better than most tools.

> And yes — **even a fresh Next.js app is a monolith by default**, so you still benefit from pnpm’s speed and efficiency.

### Common misconceptions I encountered on Twitter

- **"Isn’t pnpm only for monorepos?"**

  > Nope. It brings value to monoliths too: faster installs, disk savings, and strict dependency checks.

- **"Is pnpm used in production?"**

  > Absolutely. Vercel, Vue, Astro, and many more rely on it.

- **"So I just run `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`?"**

  > Exactly. You can even alias `pnpm` to `npm` if muscle memory is strong. 😅

### Getting started

Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@latest-10
```

Then use it just like npm:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm add axios
```

Helpful commands:

- `pnpm why <pkg>` – Find out why a package is installed
- `pnpm update --latest` – Upgrade all deps easily
- `pnpm dlx <tool>` – Run CLI tools without global install

### Final thoughts

Whether you’re building a side project or managing a full monorepo, PNPM is a serious upgrade. It’s faster, cleaner, and helps avoid common dependency issues.

Give it a shot on your next project — your future self (and your disk space) will thank you. ⚡
